# 🎯 Wharton Phishing Simulation

This repository documents a controlled phishing simulation conducted for **educational and ethical purposes**. The simulation mimicked a professional email from "Wharton Certification" to test how users respond to credential harvesting attempts using a fake Google login page.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Gophish** – for sending phishing emails and capturing credentials.
- **Ngrok** – for exposing the phishing page to the internet.
- **Google Forms** – for collecting target emails (with consent).
